I wanted to find a way to help manage organizations/clubs, automate a few things here and there, admin dashboard, email notifications, etc...
I looked it ways to do that. Some options are Google Sheet with Google Apps Script, Airtable (Free Plan), CiviCRM, DIY Web app, etc... I opted for the DIY Web App option. I believe that this option can be also be a decent project, especially since I already have a domain name, a home server, and some experience working on similar project.

For the DIY Web App options I did some research on ways to implement it and I settled for the following stack:
    Backend: Node.js, Express
    Frontend: Next.js
    Email: Nodemailer
    Database: MongoDB Atlas
    Auth: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
    API: REST
    Repo: GitHub

The repo for the project have the following structure:
    /backend
    /frontend
    /shared
    /docs
        journal.txt
        command-log.txt
    README.md
