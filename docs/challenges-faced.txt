1 - Computer was already using port 5000 for AirPlay, but I didnâ€™t realize it at first. The app reported that Node was successfully running on port 5000, so everything seemed fine. However, all incoming requests were being intercepted and rejected by AirPlay before they could reach the Node server. I discovered this by running `curl -v localhost:5000` and noticed the unexpected responses. Eventually, I resolved the issue by changing the server port from 5000 to 5001.
2 - I had forgotten to include `app.use(express.json())` in the `server.js` file. As a result, the server could not process the API requests properly.
