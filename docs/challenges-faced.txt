1 - Computer was already using port 5000 for AirPlay, but I didnâ€™t realize it at first. The app reported that Node was successfully running on port 5000, so everything seemed fine. However, all incoming requests were being intercepted and rejected by AirPlay before they could reach the Node server. I discovered this by running `curl -v localhost:5000` and noticed the unexpected responses. Eventually, I resolved the issue by changing the server port from 5000 to 5001.
2 - I had forgotten to include `app.use(express.json())` in the `server.js` file. As a result, the server could not process the API requests properly.
3 -  I ran into an issue where any field that I am trying ot update would give an error saying that status validation failed. It turns out that I had update one of the status option from 'pending' to 'Pending' and did not update the default value for status if it's not included. After fixing that, I ran into another error where status would always update to Pending on any Patch update of any other param. It was because it was applying the daufaults to patch updates. I fixed that disabling it.
